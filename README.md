# Weather-Scawler 
This is an app i've built for an interview  <br>
stack is node express js html css bootstrap ajax json <br>
the purpose of this app is to scrape and imitate an exsiting weather engine without using API <br>
The logic is simple : User end types city, info is parsed and sent to server which then calls the 2nd sever to retreive the info
Once the callback is finished fron the secondary server the data is passed as an object back to the user where its cleaned and presented
as nice as possible :)
